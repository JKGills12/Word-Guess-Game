# Word-Guess-Game

## Overview
A web app game that uses HTML/CSS for design and powered by JavaScript code for the interactive features. This game will require the user to input a guessed letter by clicking on the desired alphabet. The user is provided with 10 attempts at guessing the right word. If the word isn't guessed correctly, the user loses that guess and it moves onto the next word.

Random category became undefined for a few of the words I had picked.
Couldn't remember how to get the scoreboard working.
