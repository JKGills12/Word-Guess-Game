# Word-Guess-Game

## Overview
In this assignment, you'll create one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

## Before You Begin
Create a new GitHub repo called Word Guess Game or Psychic-Game, in accordance with the assignment you choose to complete. Then, clone it to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create an index.html.

While still in your local git repo, create a directory called assets.

cd your way into the assets folder, then make three additional folders: javascript, css and images.

In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js. Use the src attribute of the script tag to link to this file, rather than embedding the code directly in your HTML document. In the css folder, make a file called style.css. Also in the css folder, make a file called reset.css. Paste into it the code from the Meyerweb reset stylesheet. If you opt to use Bootstrap instead of writing your own CSS, skip this step, and simply include a link to Bootstrap via CDN. In the images folder, save whatever images you plan on using.

├── assets <br/>
| ├── css <br/>
| | └── style.css <br/>
| ├── images <br/>
| └── javascript <br/>
| └── game.js <br/>
└── index.html <br/>

Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Notes 
This is a project where we are to write codes on creating a word guess game where the user will have to guess what the word it within a certain number of tries.

Things I didn't fully complete - an active "Let's Play" button.
Was supposed to have it transition from intro screen to game screen.
Random category became undefined for a few of the words I had picked.
Couldn't remember how to get the scoreboard working.
