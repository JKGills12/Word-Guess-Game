# Word-Guess-Game

This is a project where we are to write codes on creating a word guess game where the user will have to guess what the word it within a certain number of tries.

Things I didn't fully complete - an active "Let's Play" button.
Was supposed to have it transition from intro screen to game screen.
Random category became undefined for a few of the words I had picked.
Couldn't remember how to get the scoreboard working.
